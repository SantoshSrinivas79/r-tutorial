# Publishing {#pub}

This chapter is for outputting results to tables, graphs, reports and interactive interfaces.

For now, it's not part of the book (determined by bookdown.yml). In fact, it's just a dumping ground for things I should read later.

# Tables

CRAN tables package by Murdoch for multilevel tables

## Saving as images


## Code for copy-pasting

into LaTeX or html


# Graphs

probably still not using packages beyond base + lattice


# Static documents

a single target document (like a paper)

it doesn't require rmd file: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_report_from_r_script.html

regular reports


# Dynamic output

## Interactive graphs

rgl
shiny
DT
