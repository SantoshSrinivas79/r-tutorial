# Getting work done {#work}

This chapter covers common analytical tasks (without any discussion of their statisical justification).

## Quick math tools

curve()


## Regression

(so far, we've just talked about data manipulation, now onto math/stats)

obvs, if your problem has a closed form solution, do the matrix algebra and don't get bogged down in syntax oddities of a particular language

seriously consider using a matrix or array if it fits the problem

### The formula interface


### Alternatives to the formula interface

## Optimization

of course, we end up with an approximation

## Integration

of course, we end up with an approximation
