Chapters \\@ref(basics) and \\@ref(quirks) will get you up to speed on navigating R. Chapter \\@ref(work) covers common tasks: working with data and running optimization routines. The final chapter covers tables and graphs; my suggestions for programming; and various pitfalls. \n \n\n## Getting started\n\nGo to [the R project site](https://www.r-project.org/) and follow the instructions to download the latest version from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network.\n\nAfter installation, I know of two good options for running R on Windows:\n\n- Hook up R to notepad++ with [NppToR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/npptor/). This allows you to edit R scripts alongside all other documents. Commands are passed to the R console by customizable shortcuts and switching between multiple running consoles is easy.\n\n- Install [the Rstudio development environment](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is restricted to one instance of R at a time and has a clumsy interface (no drag-and-drop of scripts into the editor, nor data into the console; an unhidable sidebar). On the other hand, it has handy \"development\" features that made compiling this tutorial a snap and would probably prove helpful if writing a package to contribute to CRAN.\n\nRstudio also has the nice feature of not requiring administrator privileges for installation, which makes it a good choice for trying out R.\n\n",
