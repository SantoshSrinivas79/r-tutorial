# Quirks {#quirks}

This chapter is for when you know the right tool for the job, but don't know where it is in R; or for when you have picked up a tool, but it is behaving less like a hammer than a staple-gun shooting you in the foot.

## Tallying

coercion of logical to integer -- very useful

table

plot.table

note -- methods("plot"), methods(class="table")

tallying continuous variables with cut

## Finding a value or interval

match with lists is not great

findInterval

## Set operations

%in% is really match

we'll see these again with data.tables

## Runs and sequences

seq is dangerous

rle is excellent

## `lapply` {#lapply}
