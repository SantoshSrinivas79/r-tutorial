## Vectors

In R, all data come in vectors. If you type `x = 12`, then `x` will be a numeric vector of length 1. Similarly, `y = c("A", "Z")` is a character vector of length 2. After assigning a vector, you can type its name to see it and use `length` and `class` to see those attributes.

```{r length}
x = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
length(x)
class(x)
x
```

You can assign with `=` or `<-`. You can even do `c(2,3) -> z`, but this is rare and hard to read in my opinion.
