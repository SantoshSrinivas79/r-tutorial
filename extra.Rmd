# Miscellaneous {#extra}

This chapter is a WIP, a dumping location for things I am not putting a priority on covering, mostly because I don't know them well enough.

For now, it's not part of the book (determined by bookdown.yml).



## Program structure and style

    never ever do DT <- DT[...], makes the code impossible to maintain, and it's not like you need to economise on RAM or something
    
    
    clearly separate data processing from analysis, to the point where you could easily split them into two separate scripts in a few minutes if needed
    
    similarly, separate analysis from generation of output tables and graphs
    
    similarly, separate run parameters related to each stage into groups in the preamble
    
    define dirs at the top of the file and always refer to them by var name, not raw path
    
    never use T and F as shortcuts to TRUE and FALSE. in economics, F is a CDF and T is the number of periods; and i'm sure other fields have similar conventions
    
    
    ### Mapping values
    
    always have a table, either as an input csv or defined in the program
    
    merge on that table -- don't do if-else
    
    if you're making a categorical variable in some more complicated way that demands an if-else structure, still save the resulting map 
  
    ### Reproducible research
    
    develop and publish a package? maybe. sounds like overkill to me
    
    knitr/rmarkdown seem promising, plus whatever that tool is that bundles/snapshots package versions


## The formula interface {#formula-interface}
    
    i'll just leave this collection here until i learn more

    needed for regression, whether with `model.matrix` or a regression function like `lm`
    
    also needed for reshaping, whether with `aggregate` or `dcast`
    
    read the docs carefully for the syntax, which is quite nice. however, it's not so easy to change a formula
    
    do what you can to minimize its scope

## Advanced tools

    ### Profiling
    
    common sense takes you a long ways. i have never needed profiling -- just think carefully about your problem and notice when you're stepping into combinatorially costly operations.
    
    options(datatable.verbose = TRUE)
    
    debugonce()
    
    (whatever else for profiling)
    
    
    ### Rcpp {#rcpp}
    
    it can speed up your code
    
    it is dead simple to read and write
    
    it is often be more elegant, e.g., because C++ has unordered sets as a basic data type http://stackoverflow.com/a/35559972 and also linked lists and such. all the nice stuff proper programming languages have
    
    R itself is written in C, as is the core functionality of data.table
    
    
    ### Parallelization
    
    e.g., for bootstrapping. the cheap way is to use perl or r to write a script that calls the program many times

    ### Working with files on disk
    
    yeah, this seems to be changing all the time
    
    database interfacing and such, maybe you are tied to the DB and can't switch to R (no problem); maybe you can't fit the data in memory (start over from the beginning and rethink everything and/or learn AWS)
    

## Graph theory

Don't reinvent the wheel. Use igraph if it fits

## Dynamic programming

i did it with data.table, but there may be more efficient approaches that rely only on matrices


## Asking questions online

not worth the bother to add this

if using random example data, use set.seed

test the example in a new session to make sure it runs on its own

built-in data sets

don't worry about making objects with the same names as built-ins (rivers, state.abb, etc)

use built-in data sets or simple hand-made examples

provide expected output

isolate the problem

if it's a performance question, write the example as a function of n and look at other good performance questions

try your code in a new R session to make sure it works as you described

if it's regex (it's usually regex), maybe don't post to SO, try chat


library(help="datasets") as here http://stackoverflow.com/a/8368263/
