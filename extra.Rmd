## Finding solutions

The documentation included during installation (\@ref(docs)) is the best resource. Beyond base R, the Task Views (\@ref(cran)) are a good way to see what is on CRAN. And beyond CRAN, specialized repositories offer further packages, like Bioconductor for bioinformatics.

The R website's [help page](https://www.r-project.org/help.html) has a great overview of resources to use when you have a programming problem. It's worth reading all the way through.

### Pinning down a problem

The first step is to talk through the problem, even if no one is around to listen:

> *totally commit* to asking a thorough, detailed question of this imaginary person or inanimate object. 
> 
> -- Jeff Atwood, [Rubber Duck Problem Solving](https://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/)

This rubber-ducking often solves it. If the problem persists, work on making a self-contained example of what you want to happen: reproducible input and associated desired output. Test code for the example in a new R session, since it's possible that attached objects and packages will introduce confusing complications. 

This example-building often solves it. If the problem persists, the next step is to formulate a question built around the example. This requires explaining the problem succinctly. For some advice on how to ask a good question, see [BrodieG's post](stackoverflow.com/a/28481250/). If asking folks online (instead of colleagues), make sure to formulate the question with reference to the example; for a good question, folks shouldn't need to know about your full project. 

### Asking a question online

The two main venues for questions, also identified on the R website's [help page](https://www.r-project.org/help.html), are:

* mailing lists

* Stack Overflow ("SO")

There are different rules for posting to each mailing list and to SO. It will be expected that every poster has read these rules and [exhausted other resources](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/261593).

Here are some common question types:

- **Parsing (date-time or regex).** This tutorial has some pointers for date-time (\@ref(dates-times)) and string parsing (\@ref(strings)) issues. Make sure you've gone through the relevant docs and their examples, e.g., `example(gsub)` or `example(as.Date)`. 

- **Performance.** For a question like "How can I write this code better?", consider the Code Review Stack Exchange site. Like SO and the mailing lists, it has its own posting guidelines. And look into profiling, `?Rprof`. If it's related to data.table, toggle verbose messages on with `options(datatable.verbose = TRUE)` before running the code.

    For a question like "What is the fastest way to do x?", make sure the example is big enough so timing matters. Generally, it is best to write a parameterized example, e.g., with `n` for the number of rows, `ng` for the number of groups, or similar. Common functions for timing are `system.time`; `benchmark` from the `rbenchmark` package; and `microbenchmark` from the `microbenchmark` package. Here's a [good example question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/33027611).
  
- **Recommendations.** Questions asking about which package or software to use usually don't yield good answers. Better to investigate directly, but mailing lists may serve as a last resort, assuming their posting rules allow it.
