# Date class (cr random folks,  i guess)

    # Jumbled notes

    - `Date`: Stores time as number of days since UNIX epoch on `1970-01-01`. with negative values for earlier dates.
    - It is represented as an integer (however, it is not enforced in the internal representation)
    - They are always printed following the rules of the current Gregorian calendar, even though the calendar was not in use a long time ago. 
    - It doesn't keep track of timezones, so it should not be used to truncate the time out of `POSIXct` or `POSIXlt` objects.
    - `sys.Date()` returns an object of class `Date`

    # More notes
    - [lubridate](https://github.com/hadley/lubridate)'s `ymd`, `mdy`, etc. are alternatives to `as.Date` that also parse to Date class; see [Parsing dates and datetimes from strings with lubridate](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/r/1157/date-and-time/7018/parsing-dates-and-datetimes-from-strings-with-lubridate).
    - [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki)'s experimental IDate class is derived from and is mostly interchangeable with Date, but is stored as integer instead of double.

    Pitfalls

    With POSIXct, midnight will display only the date and time zone, though the full time is still stored.

    ## Time zones
    - The accepted values of `tz` depend on the location.
        - `CST` is given with `"CST6CDT"` or `"America/Chicago"`
    - For supported locations and time zones use:
        - In R: `OlsonNames()` 
        - Alternatively, try in R: `system("cat $R_HOME/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab")`
    - These locations are given by [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](http://www.iana.org/time-zones) 
        - [List of tz database time zones (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)

# sets

A set contains only one copy of each distinct element. Unlike some other programming languages, base R does not have a dedicated data type for sets. Instead, R treats a vector like a set by taking only its distinct elements. This applies to the set operators, `setdiff`, `intersect`, `union`, `setequal` and `%in%`. For `v %in% S`, only `S` is treated as a set, however, not the vector `v`.

For a true set data type in R, the Rcpp package provides [some options][1].

## dupe drop

(note still not a "set", since it has an ordered index)

 # pipery

Pipe operators, available in magrittr and other R packages, build a sequence of operations by passing the result of one step as input for the next step.

Pipe operators, available in `magrittr`, `dplyr`, and other R packages, process a data-object using a sequence of operations by passing the result of one step as input for the next step using infix-operators rather than the more typical R method of nested function calls.

The `magrittr` package also provides several variations of the pipe operator for those who want more flexibility in piping, such as the compound assignment pipe `%<>%`, the exposition pipe `%$%`, and the tee operator `%T>%`. It also provides a suite of alias functions to replace common functions that have special syntax (`+`, `[`, `[[`, etc.) so that they can be easily used within a chain of pipes.

## syntax

    - lhs %>% rhs    # pipe syntax for `rhs(lhs)`

    - lhs %>% rhs(a = 1)    # pipe syntax for `rhs(lhs, a = 1)`

    - lhs %>% rhs(a = 1, b = .)    # pipe syntax for `rhs(a = 1, b = lhs)`

    - lhs %<>% rhs    # pipe syntax for `lhs <- rhs(lhs)`

    - lhs %$% rhs(a)  # pipe syntax for `with(lhs, rhs(lhs$a))`

    - lhs %T>% rhs  # pipe syntax for `{ rhs(lhs); lhs }`
