# Introduction

This book covers the basics of using R, without going into discussion of statistical methodology. Chapters \@ref(basics) and \@ref(quirks) will get you up to speed on navigating R. Chapter \@ref(work) covers common tasks: working with data and running optimization routines. The final chapter covers tables and graphs; my suggestions for programming; and various computational pitfalls.

## Getting started with R

Go to [the R project site](https://www.r-project.org/) and follow the instructions to download the latest version from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

After installation, I know of two good options for running R on Windows:

- Hook up R to notepad++ with [NppToR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/npptor/). This allows you to edit R scripts alongside all other documents. Commands are passed to the R console by customizable shortcuts and switching between multiple running consoles is easy.

- Install [the Rstudio development environment](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is restricted to one instance of R at a time and has a clumsy interface (no drag-and-drop of scripts into the editor, nor data into the console; an unhidable sidebar). On the other hand, it has handy "development" features that made compiling this tutorial a snap and would probably prove helpful if writing a package to contribute to CRAN.

Rstudio also has the nice feature of not requiring administrator privileges for installation, which makes it a good choice for trying out R.

## About this book

The book's R code was compiled using R, maintained by [the R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/); written in the [Rstudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/); and typeset with [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) by RStudio. Icons are from the ["Very Basic. Android L Lollipop" set by Ivan Boyko](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/very-basic-android-l-lollipop).

  Some notes give technical details and can be skipped.

  Other notes warn about inconsistencies and pitfalls and should be read.

Exercises are interspersed and should be pretty quick to do.
