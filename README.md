This book covers the essentials for using R.
  
It is built on R and Rstudio's bookdown project https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown

Viewable at http://franknarf1.github.io/r-tutorial/_book/index.html

This is my first Github project. Please let me know if you have any input. I'll probably mostly update offline since I'm still learning git.
