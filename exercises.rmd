It probably won't compile as a proper rmd.

## data.table Syntax and features

    # Basic syntax

    `DT[where, select|update|do, by]` syntax is used to work with columns of a data.table.
     - The "where" part is the `i` argument
     - The "select|update|do" part is the `j` argument

    These two arguments are usually passed by position instead of by name.

    A sequence of steps can be chained like `DT[...][...]`.

    # Shortcuts, special functions and special symbols inside `DT[...]`
    | Function or symbol | Notes |
    | ------  | ------ |
    | `.()`   | in several arguments, replaces `list()`
    | `J()`   | in `i`, replaces `list()`
    | `:=`    | in `j`, a function used to add or modify columns
    | `.N`    | in `i`, the total number of rows <br> in `j`, the number of rows in a group
    | `.I`    | in `j`, the vector of row numbers in the table (filtered by `i`)
    | `.SD`   | in `j`, the current subset of the data <br> selected by the `.SDcols` argument
    | `.GRP`  | in `j`, the current index of the subset of the data
    | `.BY`   | in `j`, the list of by values for the current subset of data
    | `V1, V2, ...`  | default names for unnamed columns created in `j`

    # Joins inside `DT[...]` 

    | Notation | Notes |
    | ------  | ------ |
    | `DT1[DT2, on, j]`  | join two tables
    | `i.*`  | special prefix on DT2's columns after the join
    | `by=.EACHI`  | special option available only with a join
    | `DT1[!DT2, on, j]`  | anti-join two tables
    | `DT1[DT2, on, roll, j]`  | join two tables, rolling on the last column in `on=`

    # Reshaping, stacking and splitting

    | Notation | Notes |
    | ------  | ------ |
    | `melt(DT, id.vars, measure.vars)`  | transform to long format  <br> for multiple columns, use `measure.vars = patterns(...)`
    | `dcast(DT, formula)`  | transform to wide format
    | `rbind(DT1, DT2, ...)`  | stack enumerated data.tables
    | `rbindlist(DT_list, idcol)`  | stack a list of data.tables 
    | `split(DT, by)`  | split a data.table into a list 

    # Some other functions specialized for data.tables

    | Function(s) | Notes |
    | ------  | ------ |
    | `foverlaps` | overlap joins
    | `merge` | another way of joining two tables
    | `set` | another way of adding or modifying columns
    | `fintersect`, `fsetdiff`, <br> `funion`, `fsetequal`, <br> `unique`, `duplicated`, `anyDuplicated` | set-theory operations with rows as elements  
    | `CJ`| the Cartesian product of vectors
    | `uniqueN`  | the number of distinct rows
    | `rowidv(DT, cols)`  | row ID (1 to .N) within each group determined by cols
    | `rleidv(DT, cols)`  | group ID (1 to .GRP) within each group determined by runs of cols
    | `shift(DT, n)` | apply a shift operator to every column
    | `setorder`, `setcolorder`, <br> `setnames`, `setkey`, `setindex`, <br> `setattr` | modify attributes and order by reference

    # Other features of the package

    | Features | Notes |
    | ------  | ------ |
    | `IDate` and `ITime` | integer dates and times
